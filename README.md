# reference-media-type
Add a new type for citations.

## Background

As an important component in literal production in academic areas, references are used to link content and evidence articles. However, it's paid little attention in most productivity tools. 
External web link is supported in most software nowadays, I'm willing to give reference media type as a first-level citizen in multi-media documents.


## Plan 

[] Develop a notion enhancer plugin for a reference type.
